Micrograd from scratch
- 
Demonsrates the concepts of forward passes and backpropogation at the most fundamental level using simple mathematical expressions and basic calculus, as well as visual graphics

Micrograd Pytorch
- 
Reimplements above code using Pytorch library, giving basic introduction to step by step process of optimizing a neural network
